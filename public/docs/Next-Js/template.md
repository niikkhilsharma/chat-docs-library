A **template** file is similar to a
[layout](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/pages-and-layouts#layouts)
in that it wraps each child layout or page. Unlike layouts that persist
across routes and maintain state, templates create a new instance for
each of their children on navigation.

`tsx filename="app/template.tsx" switcher export default function Template({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {   return <div>{children}</div> }`

`jsx filename="app/template.jsx" switcher export default function Template({ children }) {   return <div>{children}</div> }`

`<Image
  alt="template.js special file"
  srcLight="/docs/light/template-special-file.png"
  srcDark="/docs/dark/template-special-file.png"
  width="1600"
  height="444"
/>`{=html}

While less common, you might choose a template over a layout if you
want:

-   Features that rely on `useEffect` (e.g logging page views) and
    `useState` (e.g a per-page feedback form).
-   To change the default framework behavior. For example, Suspense
    Boundaries inside layouts only show the fallback the first time the
    Layout is loaded and not when switching pages. For templates, the
    fallback is shown on each navigation.

## Props

### `children` (required)

Template components should accept and use a `children` prop. `template`
is rendered between a
[layout](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/layout) and its
children. For example:

`jsx filename="Output" <Layout>   {/* Note that the template is given a unique key. */}   <Template key={routeParam}>{children}</Template> </Layout>`

> **Good to know**:
>
> -   By default, `template` is a [Server
>     Component](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components),
>     but can also be used as a [Client
>     Component](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/client-components)
>     through the `"use client"` directive.
> -   When a user navigates between routes that share a `template`, a
>     new instance of the component is mounted, DOM elements are
>     recreated, state is **not** preserved, and effects are
>     re-synchronized.
