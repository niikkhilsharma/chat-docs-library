Partial Prerendering is an experimental feature that allows static
portions of a route to be prerendered and served from the cache with
dynamic holes streamed in, all in a single HTTP request.

Partial Prerendering is available in `next@canary`:

`bash filename="Terminal" npm install next@canary`

You can enable Partial Prerendering by setting the experimental `ppr`
flag:

\`\`\`js filename="next.config.js" /\*\* @type
{import('next').NextConfig} \*/ const nextConfig = { experimental: {
ppr: true, }, }

module.exports = nextConfig \`\`\`

> **Good to know:**
>
> -   Partial Prerendering does not yet apply to client-side
>     navigations. We are actively working on this.
> -   Partial Prerendering is designed for the [Node.js
>     runtime](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/edge-and-nodejs-runtimes)
>     only. Using the subset of the Node.js runtime is not needed when
>     you can instantly serve the static shell.
