Some packages can export hundreds or thousands of modules, which can
cause performance issues in development and production.

Adding a package to `experimental.optimizePackageImports` will only load
the modules you are actually using, while still giving you the
convenience of writing import statements with many named exports.

`js filename="next.config.js" module.exports = {   experimental: {     optimizePackageImports: ['package-name'],   }, }`

Libraries like `@mui/icons-material`, `@mui/material`, `date-fns`,
`lodash`, `lodash-es`, `react-bootstrap`, `@headlessui/react`,
`@heroicons/react`, and `lucide-react` are already optimized by default.
