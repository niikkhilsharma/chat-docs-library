There are three ways to navigate between routes in Next.js:

-   Using the [`<Link>` Component](#link-component)
-   Using the [`useRouter` Hook](#userouter-hook)
-   Using the native [History API](#using-the-native-history-api)

This page will go through how to use each of these options, and dive
deeper into how navigation works.

## `<Link>` Component

`<Link>` is a built-in component that extends the HTML `<a>` tag to
provide [prefetching](#2-prefetching) and client-side navigation between
routes. It is the primary and recommended way to navigate between routes
in Next.js.

You can use it by importing it from `next/link`, and passing a `href`
prop to the component:

\`\`\`tsx filename="app/page.tsx" switcher import Link from 'next/link'

export default function Page() { return
`<Link href="/dashboard">`{=html}Dashboard`</Link>`{=html} }


    ```jsx filename="app/page.js" switcher
    import Link from 'next/link'

    export default function Page() {
      return <Link href="/dashboard">Dashboard</Link>
    }

There are other optional props you can pass to `<Link>`. See the [API
reference](/docs/app/api-reference/components/link) for more.

### Examples

#### Linking to Dynamic Segments

When linking to [dynamic
segments](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes),
you can use [template literals and
interpolation](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals)
to generate a list of links. For example, to generate a list of blog
posts:

\`\`\`jsx filename="app/blog/PostList.js" import Link from 'next/link'

export default function PostList({ posts }) { return (
```{=html}
<ul>
```
{posts.map((post) =\> (
```{=html}
<li key="{post.id}">
```
``<Link href={`/blog/${post.slug}`}>``{=html}{post.title}`</Link>`{=html}
```{=html}
</li>
```
))}
```{=html}
</ul>
```
) }


    #### Checking Active Links

    You can use [`usePathname()`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/use-pathname) to determine if a link is active. For example, to add a class to the active link, you can check if the current `pathname` matches the `href` of the link:

    ```tsx filename="app/components/links.tsx" switcher
    'use client'

    import { usePathname } from 'next/navigation'
    import Link from 'next/link'

    export function Links() {
      const pathname = usePathname()

      return (
        <nav>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <Link className={`link ${pathname === '/' ? 'active' : ''}`} href="/">
                Home
              </Link>
            </li>
            <li>
              <Link
                className={`link ${pathname === '/about' ? 'active' : ''}`}
                href="/about"
              >
                About
              </Link>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </nav>
      )
    }

\`\`\`jsx filename="app/components/links.js" switcher 'use client'

import { usePathname } from 'next/navigation' import Link from
'next/link'

export function Links() { const pathname = usePathname()

return (
```{=html}
<nav>
```
```{=html}
<ul>
```
```{=html}
<li>
```
\<Link className={`link ${pathname === '/' ? 'active' : ''}`} href="/"\>
Home `</Link>`{=html}
```{=html}
</li>
```
```{=html}
<li>
```
\<Link className={`link ${pathname === '/about' ? 'active' : ''}`}
href="/about" \> About `</Link>`{=html}
```{=html}
</li>
```
```{=html}
</ul>
```
```{=html}
</nav>
```
) }


    #### Scrolling to an `id`

    The default behavior of the Next.js App Router is to scroll to the top of a new route or to maintain the scroll position for backwards and forwards navigation.

    If you'd like to scroll to a specific `id` on navigation, you can append your URL with a `#` hash link or just pass a hash link to the `href` prop. This is possible since `<Link>` renders to an `<a>` element.

    ```jsx
    <Link href="/dashboard#settings">Settings</Link>

    // Output
    <a href="/dashboard#settings">Settings</a>

#### Disabling scroll restoration

The default behavior of the Next.js App Router is to scroll to the top
of a new route or to maintain the scroll position for backwards and
forwards navigation. If you'd like to disable this behavior, you can
pass `scroll={false}` to the `<Link>` component, or `scroll: false` to
`router.push()` or `router.replace()`.

``` jsx
// next/link
<Link href="/dashboard" scroll={false}>
  Dashboard
</Link>
```

``` jsx
// useRouter
import { useRouter } from 'next/navigation'

const router = useRouter()

router.push('/dashboard', { scroll: false })
```

## `useRouter()` Hook

The `useRouter` hook allows you to programmatically change routes from
Client Components. For Server Components, you would
[`redirect()`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/redirect) instead.

\`\`\`jsx filename="app/page.js" 'use client'

import { useRouter } from 'next/navigation'

export default function Page() { const router = useRouter()

return ( \<button type="button" onClick={() =\>
router.push('/dashboard')}\> Dashboard `</button>`{=html} ) }


    For a full list of `useRouter` methods, see the [API reference](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/use-router).

    > **Recommendation:** Use the `<Link>` component to navigate between routes unless you have a specific requirement for using `useRouter`.

    ## Using the native History API

    Next.js allows you to use the native [`window.history.pushState`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History/pushState) and [`window.history.replaceState`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History/replaceState) methods to update the browser's history stack without reloading the page.

    `pushState` and `replaceState` calls integrate into the Next.js Router, allowing you to sync with [`usePathname`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/use-pathname) and [`useSearchParams`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/use-search-params).

    ### `window.history.pushState`

    Use it to add a new entry to the browser's history stack. The user can navigate back to the previous state. For example, to sort a list of products:

    ```tsx fileName="app/ui/sort-products.tsx" switcher
    'use client'

    import { useSearchParams } from 'next/navigation'

    export default function SortProducts() {
      const searchParams = useSearchParams()

      function updateSorting(sortOrder: string) {
        const params = new URLSearchParams(searchParams.toString())
        params.set('sort', sortOrder)
        window.history.pushState(null, '', `?${params.toString()}`)
      }

      return (
        <>
          <button onClick={() => updateSorting('asc')}>Sort Ascending</button>
          <button onClick={() => updateSorting('desc')}>Sort Descending</button>
        </>
      )
    }

\`\`\`jsx fileName="app/ui/sort-products.js" switcher 'use client'

import { useSearchParams } from 'next/navigation'

export default function SortProducts() { const searchParams =
useSearchParams()

function updateSorting(sortOrder) { const params = new
URLSearchParams(searchParams.toString()) params.set('sort', sortOrder)
window.history.pushState(null, '', `?${params.toString()}`) }

return ( \<\> \<button onClick={() =\> updateSorting('asc')}\>Sort
Ascending`</button>`{=html} \<button onClick={() =\>
updateSorting('desc')}\>Sort Descending`</button>`{=html} \</\> ) }


    ### `window.history.replaceState`

    Use it to replace the current entry on the browser's history stack. The user is not able to navigate back to the previous state. For example, to switch the application's locale:

    ```tsx fileName="app/ui/locale-switcher.tsx" switcher
    'use client'

    import { usePathname } from 'next/navigation'

    export function LocaleSwitcher() {
      const pathname = usePathname()

      function switchLocale(locale: string) {
        // e.g. '/en/about' or '/fr/contact'
        const newPath = `/${locale}${pathname}`
        window.history.replaceState(null, '', newPath)
      }

      return (
        <>
          <button onClick={() => switchLocale('en')}>English</button>
          <button onClick={() => switchLocale('fr')}>French</button>
        </>
      )
    }

\`\`\`jsx fileName="app/ui/locale-switcher.js" switcher 'use client'

import { usePathname } from 'next/navigation'

export function LocaleSwitcher() { const pathname = usePathname()

function switchLocale(locale) { // e.g.Â '/en/about' or '/fr/contact'
const newPath = `/${locale}${pathname}`
window.history.replaceState(null, '', newPath) }

return ( \<\> \<button onClick={() =\>
switchLocale('en')}\>English`</button>`{=html} \<button onClick={() =\>
switchLocale('fr')}\>French`</button>`{=html} \</\> ) } \`\`\`

## How Routing and Navigation Works

The App Router uses a hybrid approach for routing and navigation. On the
server, your application code is automatically
[code-split](#1-code-splitting) by route segments. And on the client,
Next.js [prefetches](#2-prefetching) and [caches](#3-caching) the route
segments. This means, when a user navigates to a new route, the browser
doesn't reload the page, and only the route segments that change
re-render - improving the navigation experience and performance.

### 1. Code Splitting

Code splitting allows you to split your application code into smaller
bundles to be downloaded and executed by the browser. This reduces the
amount of data transferred and execution time for each request, leading
to improved performance.

Server Components allow your application code to be automatically
code-split by route segments. This means only the code needed for the
current route is loaded on navigation.

### 2. Prefetching

Prefetching is a way to preload a route in the background before the
user visits it.

There are two ways routes are prefetched in Next.js:

-   **`<Link>` component**: Routes are automatically prefetched as they
    become visible in the user's viewport. Prefetching happens when the
    page first loads or when it comes into view through scrolling.
-   **`router.prefetch()`**: The `useRouter` hook can be used to
    prefetch routes programmatically.

The`<Link>`'s prefetching behavior is different for static and dynamic
routes:

-   [**Static
    Routes**](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components#static-rendering-default):
    `prefetch` defaults to `true`. The entire route is prefetched and
    cached.
-   [**Dynamic
    Routes**](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components#dynamic-rendering):
    `prefetch` default to automatic. Only the shared layout, down the
    rendered "tree" of components until the first `loading.js` file, is
    prefetched and cached for `30s`. This reduces the cost of fetching
    an entire dynamic route, and it means you can show an [instant
    loading
    state](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/loading-ui-and-streaming#instant-loading-states)
    for better visual feedback to users.

You can disable prefetching by setting the `prefetch` prop to `false`.

See the [`<Link>` API
reference](/docs/app/api-reference/components/link) for more
information.

> **Good to know**:
>
> -   Prefetching is not enabled in development, only in production.

### 3. Caching

Next.js has an **in-memory client-side cache** called the [Router
Cache](/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/fetching-caching-and-revalidating#caching-data#router-cache).
As users navigate around the app, the React Server Component Payload of
[prefetched](#2-prefetching) route segments and visited routes are
stored in the cache.

This means on navigation, the cache is reused as much as possible,
instead of making a new request to the server - improving performance by
reducing the number of requests and data transferred.

Learn more about how the [Router
Cache](/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/fetching-caching-and-revalidating#caching-data)
works and how to configure it.

### 4. Partial Rendering

Partial rendering means only the route segments that change on
navigation re-render on the client, and any shared segments are
preserved.

For example, when navigating between two sibling routes,
`/dashboard/settings` and `/dashboard/analytics`, the `settings` and
`analytics` pages will be rendered, and the shared `dashboard` layout
will be preserved.

`<Image
  alt="How partial rendering works"
  srcLight="/docs/light/partial-rendering.png"
  srcDark="/docs/dark/partial-rendering.png"
  width="1600"
  height="945"
/>`{=html}

Without partial rendering, each navigation would cause the full page to
re-render on the client. Rendering only the segment that changes reduces
the amount of data transferred and execution time, leading to improved
performance.

### 5. Soft Navigation

Browsers perform a "hard navigation" when navigating between pages. The
Next.js App Router enables "soft navigation" between pages, ensuring
only the route segments that have changed are re-rendered (partial
rendering). This enables client React state to be preserved during
navigation.

### 6. Back and Forward Navigation

By default, Next.js will maintain the scroll position for backwards and
forwards navigation, and re-use route segments in the [Router
Cache](/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/fetching-caching-and-revalidating#caching-data).

### 7. Routing between `pages/` and `app/`

When incrementally migrating from `pages/` to `app/`, the Next.js router
will automatically handle hard navigation between the two. To detect
transitions from `pages/` to `app/`, there is a client router filter
that leverages probabilistic checking of app routes, which can
occasionally result in false positives. By default, such occurrences
should be very rare, as we configure the false positive likelihood to be
0.01%. This likelihood can be customized via the
`experimental.clientRouterFilterAllowedRate` option in `next.config.js`.
It's important to note that lowering the false positive rate will
increase the size of the generated filter in the client bundle.

Alternatively, if you prefer to disable this handling completely and
manage the routing between `pages/` and `app/` manually, you can set
`experimental.clientRouterFilter` to false in `next.config.js`. When
this feature is disabled, any dynamic routes in pages that overlap with
app routes won't be navigated to properly by default.
